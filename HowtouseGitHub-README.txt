How to use GitHub

1. First, you need to fork a repository from GitHub.

2. Then, you need to clone the GitHub repository to your computer.

3. This will give you a local copy [on your computer] of the repository so you can make changes.

4. Make changes. Blah blah blah.

5. Then commit. Because I added you as a collaborator, you can commit changes to the repository without asking for my permission.

[ Additional info ] 6. If I don't have you as collaborator, you need a "pull request".
